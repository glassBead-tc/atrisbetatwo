An Audius Content Node is a service that stores and maintains the availability of all content across
the Audius network. Content types include user, track, and playlist metadata, images and artwork,
and audio content.

The Content Node source code is hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/AudiusProject/audius-docker-compose/tree/main/creator-node) and see the
[registered Content Nodes](https://dashboard.audius.org/#/services/content-node) on the Audius
Protocol Dashboard.

## Design Goals

1. Surface the Audius Storage Protocol for storing and serving images and audio
2. Keep data consistently replicated and available
3. Provide an interface to handle content upload, transcoding, and identification
4. Allow users to maintain agency over where and how their data is stored amongst Content Nodes

:::note Legacy Terminology

The "Content Node" may be referred to as the "Creator Node". These services are the same.

## Web Server

The Content Node core service is a web server with an HTTP API to process incoming requests and
perform the following functions:

- user & track metadata upload
- user & track image upload
- user track file upload
- user & track data, metadata, and track file retrieval

The web server is a [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) [Express app](https://expressjs.com/).

---

## Persistent Storage

It stores all data in a PostgreSQL database and all images and metadata objects on its file system.

Pointers to all content and metadata stored on disk are persisted in the Postgres DB.

Postgres is managed in the codebase using the [Sequelize ORM](https://sequelize.org/main/) which
includes migrations, models and validations

---

## Redis

A [Redis client](https://redis.io/) is used for resource locking, request rate limiting, and
limited caching and key storage.

Redis is managed in the codebase through the [ioredis npm package](https://github.com/luin/ioredis)

---

## Track Segmenting

As defined by the [Audius Whitepaper](/reference/whitepaper), the content node uses
[FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html) to segment & transcode all uploaded track files before
storing/serving.

---

## Data Redundancy

As defined by the [Audius Whitepaper](/reference/whitepaper), all content is stored redundantly
across multiple Nodes to maximize availability. This is all done automatically - every Node monitors
every other Node in the network to ensure minimum redundancy of all data, transferring files as
required.
