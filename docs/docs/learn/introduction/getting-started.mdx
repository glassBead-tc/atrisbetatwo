## Getting Started

> Audius is a digital streaming service that connects fans to artists and exclusive new music
> directly.

As a fully decentralized project, Audius is owned and run by a vibrant, open source community of
Artists, Fans, and Developers all around the world. Audius gives Artists the power to share never
before heard music and monetize streams directly with Fans. Developers can build their own apps on
top of Audius, giving them access to one of the most unique audio catalogs in existence.

Under the hood, Audius is both a protocol and a platform built on top of the blockchain (several, in
fact) and community run nodes. Audius is Open Source, Open Data & Access, and Open Ownership.

:::info Create an Audius Account

Check out the reference music player implementation at [audius.co](https://audius.co) by creating
and account and exploring new music.
