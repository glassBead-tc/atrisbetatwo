# AdvancedOptions

You can pass a `AdvancedOptions` object to any SDK write method for further control of its behavior.

## Examples

```ts
await audiusSdk.playlists.favoritePlaylist({
  playlistId: 'x5pJ3Az'
  userId: "7eP5n",
}, {
  confirmationTimeout: 30000 // Time out if the transaction takes over 30 seconds to confirm
});
```

```ts
await audiusSdk.playlists.favoritePlaylist({
  playlistId: 'x5pJ3Az'
  userId: "7eP5n",
}, {
  skipConfirmation: true // Don't wait to confirm the transaction; resolve immediately after it is sent. Only for advanced usage.
});
```

## Properties

`Optional` **confirmationTimeout**: number - The amount of time in milliseconds to wait for the
transaction to be confirmed on the blockchain before timing out. <i>Defaults to 45000</i>.

`Optional` **skipConfirmation**: boolean - Whether to resolve immediately after the transaction is
sent, instead of waiting for the transaction to be confirmed before resolving. Only for advanced
usage. <i>Defaults to false.</i>
