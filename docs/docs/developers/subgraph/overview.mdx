Audius has a GraphQL API Endpoint hosted by
[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/docs/about/introduction#what-the-graph-is) called a subgraph for
indexing and organizing data from the Audius smart contracts.

This subgraph is can be used to query Audius data.

Subgraph information is serviced by a decentralized group of server operators called Indexers.
