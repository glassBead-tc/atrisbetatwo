## Overview

The Audius Ethereum contracts are meant to accomplish the following goals for the Audius protocol:

- Create the Audius token through an ERC-20
- Keep track of different service versions
- Allow service providers to stake and register services to run
- Allow delegation from users holding Audius token to service providers running services on the
  network
- Allow network to mint new tokens for stakers and delegators to earn staking rewards
- Enable protocol governance to carry out protocol actions such as slash, and static value updates

:::info

All contracts are built on top of
[OpenZeppelin's Proxy pattern](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/proxies) through
`AudiusAdminUpgradeabilityProxy` which extends `AdminUpgradeabilityProxy`, enabling logic upgrades
to be performed through the [Governance contract](#governance).

## Contracts

> [Github Code available here](https://github.com/AudiusProject/audius-protocol/tree/main/eth-contracts/contracts)

### AudiusToken

> This contract defines the Audius Protocol token, `$AUDIO`

The `$AUDIO` token is a ERC-20 token contract with initial supply of 1 billion tokens, each
divisible up to 18 decimal places, and is `Mintable`, `Pausable`, and `Burnable`.

### ClaimsManager

> This contract is responsible for allocating and minting new tokens as well as managing claim
> rounds.

A claim round is a period of time during which service providers with valid stakes can retrieve the
reward apportioned to them in the network. Claims are processed here and new value transferred to
[Staking](#staking) for the claimer, but the values in both
[ServiceProviderFactory](#serviceproviderfactory) and [DelegateManager](#delegatemanager) are
updated through calls to [DelegateManager](#delegatemanager).

### DelegateManager

> This contract is responsible for tracking delegation state, making claims, and handling slash
> operations.

This contract allows any Audio Token holder to delegate to an existing Node Operator, earning
rewards by providing additional stake the Node Operator while allocating a known percentage of their
rewards to the Node Operator.

This contract manages the proportional distribution of stake between the Node Operator and
delegators.

All claim and slash operations flow through this contract in order to update values tracked outside
of the [Staking contract](#staking) appropriately and maintain consistency between total value
within the [Staking contract](#staking) and value tracked by the
[DelegateManager contract](#delegatemanager) and the
[ServiceProviderFactory contract](#serviceproviderfactory).

### Governance

> This contract allows protocol participants to change protocol direction by submitting and voting
> on proposals.

Each proposal represents an executable function call on a contract in the [Registry](#registry).
Once submitted, there is a period of time during which other participants can submit their votes -
`Yes` or `No` - on the proposal.

After the voting period has concluded, the proposal outcome is calculated as a the sum of the stakes
of the `Yes` voters minus the sum of the stakes of the `No` voters.

Any non-negative value results in a successful proposal, at which point the specified function call
is executed, and the proposal is closed.

Only addresses that have staked in [Staking.sol](#staking) and are represented through the
[Registry](#registry) can submit and vote on proposals.

### Registry

Contract through which external clients and Governance interact with the remaining contracts within
the protocol. Each contract is registered using a key with which its address can be queried.

| Mainnet Contract                                         | Sepolia Testnet Contract                                      |

### ServiceProviderFactory

> This contract is responsible for tracking Service Provider state within the Audius network.

A service provider is the account associated with a given service endpoint.

Each service provider can increase/decrease stake within dynamic bounds determined by the
combination of endpoints they have registered, accept delegation from other token holders, define a
reward cut for delegation, and continue registering endpoints as necessary.

This contract forwards staking requests to the actual [Staking](#staking) contract but tracks the
amount of stake for the deployer - [Staking](#staking) tracks the sum of delegate stake + deployer
stake.

<details>
<summary>A Note on Terminology</summary>

Through out the Smart Contracts that define the Audius protocol, the term "service provider" is used
along with the "service endpoint(s)" that they operate.

More current terminology is "Node Operator" and "Audius Node" respectively.

- **Old**: `Service Providers` operate `service endpoints`
- **New**: `Node Operators` operate `Audius Nodes`

</details>

### ServiceTypeManager

> This contract is responsible for maintaining known `service types`, associated versioning
> information and service type stake requirements within the Audius Protocol.

Service types are used to identify services being registered within the protocol, for example
`creator-node` or `discovery-provider`.

Service type stake requirements enforce a minimum and maximum stake amount for each endpoint of a
given type that service providers register.

<details>
<summary>A Note on Terminology</summary>

Through out the Smart Contracts that define the Audius protocol, the terms `creator-node` and
`discovery-provider` are used to define `service types`.

More current terminology is `content-node` and `discovery-node` are `Audius Node` types
respectively.

- **Old**: `creator-node` and `discovery-provider` are `service types`
- **New**: `content-node` and `discovery-node` are `Audius Node` types.

### Staking

> This contract manages token staking functions and state across the Audius Protocol

For every service provider address in Audius Protocol, this contract:

- Stores tokens and manages account balances
- Tracks total stake history
- The total stake (represented as the sun of the deployer stake plus the delegate stake)
- Tracks last claim block

### TrustedNotifierManager

This contract serves as the on chain registry of trusted notifier services. Other services may look
up and adjust their selected trusted notifier accordingly.

This contract serves as the interface between the Audius Protocol and
[Wormhole](https://solana.com/ecosystem/wormhole).
