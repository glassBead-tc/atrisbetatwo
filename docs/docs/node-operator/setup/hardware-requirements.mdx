## Hardware Requirements

In order to maintain quality service across the Audius protocol, Audius Node hardware requirements
are enforced by the on-chain governance protocol.

The minimum resource requirements per registered Node are as follows.

- a public DNS endpoint with SSL support
- operations support to enable high uptime and availability
- datacenter-quality internet connection (eg. AWS, GCP, or similar)

:::tip choosing an operating system

While any linux based operating system will work, **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS** is currently recommended.

:::

### Content Node

- 8 vCPU
- 16 GiB of RAM
- 2000 GiB (2 TiB) SSD
- Firewalls configured to allow `0.0.0.0/0` ingress on ports `80` + `443`

### Discovery Node

- 8 vCPU
- 16 GiB of RAM
- 512 GiB SSD
- Firewalls configured to allow `0.0.0.0/0` ingress on ports `80` + `443` + `30300`

---

## System Configuration

With a Virtual Machine configured, confirm the following software configurations.

### Docker is Installed

Both Content Nodes and Discovery Nodes must have docker installed.

Read more about [installing Docker on Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) on the
official Docker documentation site.

### Open Ports

When configuring Virtual Machines be sure to create firewall rules for the following ports.

- **Content Node** Firewalls should be configured to only allow `0.0.0.0/0` ingress on ports `80` +
  `443`
- **Discovery Node** Firewalls should be configured to only allow `0.0.0.0/0` ingress on ports
  `80` + `443` + `30300`

<!-- TODO: admonition for why port 30300? with links to nethermind and architecture docs -->

### SSH Access

Managing and configuring Audius Nodes requires ssh access to each Virtual Machine from a computer
you have ready access to, a laptop for example.

Store ssh credentials in the ~/.ssh/config file on your local computer. While specifics may change,
the general format is as follows:

```bash
Host content1.myurl.com                       # <--- NODE URL
  HostName 41.586.753.09                      # <--- STATIC IP OF THE NODE
  User user                                   # <--- USERNAME
  Port 22                                     # <--- COMMON SSH ACCESS PORT
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/google_compute_engine   # <--- EXAMPLE GOOGLE CLOUD IDENTITY FILE
```

Additional configurations can be added to a single `.ssh/config` file, one after the other. Check

for more information on creating and using `config` files.
