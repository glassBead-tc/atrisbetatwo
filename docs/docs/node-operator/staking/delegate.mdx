Delegation is a great place to get involved for users that either do not hold enough $AUDIO to self
[stake a Node][staking], do not want to [become a Node Operator][node-operators], or are just
looking to get started.

Delegating increases your ownership of the Protocol and earns token rewards in exchange for keeping
the Protocol healthy by supporting Node Operators.

A list of all active Node Operators can be found under the [Nodes tab][nodes-tab] on the [Audius
Protocol Dashboard][protocol-dashboard].

## How to Delegate

$AUDIO holders can delegate a minimum of 100 tokens to any Node Operator by connecting their wallet
on the [Audius Protocol Dashboard][protocol-dashboard] using Wallet Connect.

:::tip

Each Node Operator is also able to set a higher minimum delegation, keep that in mind when
evaluating Node Operators to delegate towards.

## Cooldown Period

Audius features a 7 day cooldown period to undelegate in order to provide adequate time for Nodes to
be slashed in the event of malicious behavior.
