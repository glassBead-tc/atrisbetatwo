:::warning Read this first

This portion of the guide is only for Node Operators that setup Audius Nodes using
`audius-docker-compose`.

:::

## Overview

Migrating Audius Nodes in just a few steps:

1. Disable auto-upgrade on existing Audius Nodes
2. Stop the Audius daemon on existing Audius Nodes
3. Install `audius-ctl`
4. Confirm your
   [ssh access and port configuration](/node-operator/setup/hardware-requirements#system-configuration)
5. Edit the configuration file
6. Run your Audius Nodes

---

## 1. Disable Auto-Upgrade on Existing Nodes

Disable Auto Upgrade by repeating these steps on each of you existing Audius Nodes

1. ssh into Virtual Machine

2. disable auto upgrade with the following command:

```bash
audius-cli auto-upgrade --remove
```

## 2. Stop the Audius daemon on Existing Nodes

For each Node to be migrated, you will need to ssh into the Virtual Machine, disable auto upgrade,
and `down` the Node. The workflow and required commands are as follows:

1. ssh into Virtual Machine

2. Down the Audius Node with the following command:

```bash
audius-cli down
```

---

:::tip No New Nodes

Existing Audius Nodes should be "upgraded in place", so unless you have a specific need, we strongly
recommend following this guide and doing so.

If you are starting up a new Audius Node, follow the
[Installation Guide](/node-operator/setup/installation) to get started.

:::

---

## 3. Install `audius-ctl`

Get started by opening a terminal on a local machine, this can be any computer, such as a laptop or
desktop.

Run the following command to install the controller utility, `audius-ctl`

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.audius.org | sh
```

:::info Where to install audius-ctl

While it is recommended to install the controller utility on a separate computer, such as your
laptop, any machine can operate as a Controller. Check the
[Advanced Usage page](/node-operator/setup/advanced) for more information.

:::

---

## 4. Confirm ssh Access to Audius Nodes

For `audius-ctl` to interact with your Audius Nodes, your local machine will need ssh access.

Read more about configuring
[ssh access and port configuration here.](/node-operator/setup/hardware-requirements#system-configuration)

---

## 5. Edit the Configuration File

Next you will need to edit the configuration file. Run the following command to get started:

```bash
audius-ctl config edit
```

### 5.1 Configuration Details

The configuration file will be pre-populated with the required fields. Enter your information into
each field for each Audius Node you will be running.

```bash showLineNumbers title="audius-ctl configuration file"
network:
  deployOn: mainnet
nodes:
  content-1.example.com:        # <--- THE URL OF YOUR CONTENT NODE
    type: content
    privateKey: abc123          # <--- UNIQUE PRIV KEY USED BY THIS NODE TO SIGN RESPONSES
    wallet: 0xABC123            # <--- UNIQUE WALLET ADDRESS OF ABOVE PRIV KEY
    rewardsWallet: 0xABC123     # <--- ADDRESS OF WALLET HOLDING STAKED TOKENS
  discovery-1.example.com:      # <--- THE URL OF YOUR DISCOVERY NODE
    type: discovery
    privateKey: abc123          # <--- UNIQUE PRIV KEY USED BY THIS NODE TO SIGN RESPONSES
    wallet: 0xABC123            # <--- UNIQUE WALLET ADDRESS OF ABOVE PRIV KEY
    rewardsWallet: 0xABC123     # <--- ADDRESS OF WALLET HOLDING STAKED TOKENS
```

## 6. Run Your Audius Nodes

With the configuration file setup correctly, the final command to run is:

```bash
audius-ctl up
```

This command does a few things:

1. Loops over every Audius Node specified
2. Connects to each Virtual Machine via ssh
   1. Checks that the required Audius Node software is installed
   2. If not found, runs the installer
   3. Starts the Audius Node

## Additional Information

### Environment Variable Mapping

Node Operators migrating existing Nodes will be familiar with the legacy variables for each Node
type. See the mappings below to correctly use existing keys from a `override.env` file in a new
configuration file.

- Content Node Variables

  - `delegateOwnerWallet` --> `wallet`
  - `delegatePrivateKey` --> `privateKey`

- Discovery Node Variables
  - `audius_delegate_owner_wallet` --> `wallet`
  - `audius_delegate_private_key` --> `privateKey`

:::caution Looking for Old Docs?

Please be aware that `audius-docker-compose` will soon no longer be supported.

Read the [Migration Guide](/node-operator/migration-guide) for instructions.

This guide describes how to run Audius services on a single machine via Docker Compose. The
repository of Docker Compose files can be found on
[GitHub](https://github.com/AudiusProject/audius-docker-compose).

On a VM that meets the minimum requirements from above run:

```bash
bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AudiusProject/audius-docker-compose/main/install.sh)
```

During installation there will be prompts for required environment variables. The variables are:

---

**Creator Node**

- `creatorNodeEndpoint` - The DNS of your content node. If you haven't registered the service yet,
  please enter the url you plan to register.
- `delegateOwnerWallet` - Address of wallet that contains no tokens but that is registered on chain,
  used to sign JSON responses from server
- `delegatePrivateKey` - Private key associated with `delegateOwnerWallet`
- `spOwnerWallet` - Wallet that registered (or will register) the content node on chain

---

**Discovery Node**

- `audius_delegate_owner_wallet` - Address of wallet that contains no tokens but that is registered
  on chain, used to sign JSON responses from server
- `audius_delegate_private_key` - Private key associated with `audius_delegate_owner_wallet`
