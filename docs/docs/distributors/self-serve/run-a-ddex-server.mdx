Check back soon for updates on how to run and operate own DDEX Ingestion Server.

## Instructions

1. Provision a new machine following. We recommend:

- Ubuntu
- 8 CPUs
- 16 to 32GB Memory

2. Visit [audius-docker-compose](https://github.com/AudiusProject/audius-docker-compose) and run the
   install script to set up your Audius environment on your provisioned machine.

3. Follow the instructions in the
   [audius-protocol](https://github.com/AudiusProject/audius-protocol/tree/main/packages/ddex)
   repository to set the appropriate environment variables

4. Start the DDEX Ingestion Server

```
audius-cli launch ddex
```

Your server will now be available at localhost:80 and is exposed via self-signed SSL on :443 if
`DDEX_URL` is set.
