## General Metadata Mapping

### Required Fields

The following metadata fields are required for content to be listed on Audius and are examined and
pulled from a DDEX delivery in cascading precedence.

#### coverArtFile

:::note

The `coverArtFile` maps to two DDEX Fields

:::

- `/ResourceList/Image/ImageDetailsByTerritory[TerritoryCode="Worldwide"]/TechnicalImageDetails/File/FilePath`
- `/ResourceList/Image/ImageDetailsByTerritory[TerritoryCode="Worldwide"]/TechnicalImageDetails/File/FileName`

#### releaseDate

:::note

The resource will not be published on the Audius platform until the following condition is met:

`current date ≥ max(releaseDate, validity start date from the corresponding deal)`

However the date displayed in the Audius interface will be this `releaseDate` value (determined by
the hierarchy below).

:::

1. `/ReleaseList/Release/ReleaseDetailsByTerritory[TerritoryCode="Worldwide"]/ReleaseDate`
2. `/ReleaseList/Release/GlobalOriginalReleaseDate`
3. `/DealList/ReleaseDeal/Deal/ValidityPeriod/StartDate`

#### userId

:::note

Not technically an Audius SDK metadata field, but uploaded as part of the track/album

:::

1. checks each artist name (in order) against Audius database of OAuthed display names, and uses the
   first match

---

### Optional Fields

The following fields are optional for content to be listed on Audius and are examined and pulled
from a DDEX delivery in cascading precedence.

#### ddexReleaseIds

1. `/ReleaseList/Release/ReleaseId`

:::note

The following fields are parsed and preserved from this field:

`PartyId`, `CatalogNumber`, `ICPN`, `GRid`, `ISAN`, `ISBN`, `ISMN`, `ISRC`, `ISSN`, `ISTC`, `ISWC`,
`MWLI`, `SICI`, and `ProprietaryId`

:::

#### description

The DDEX standard includes a `MarketingComments` field that is rarely used, but is available.

---

### Unused Fields

The following Audius SDK Fields are not used by DDEX and have no mapping.

store these child fields and they are not used.

- `ReferenceTitle/TitleText`
- `ReferenceTitle/SubTitle`

#### child elements of `/ReleaseList/Release/ReleaseDetailsByTerritory[TerritoryCode="Worldwide"]/`

The following child elements are parsed and stored in the separate DDEX server. Audius does not
store these child fields and they are not used.

- `Title[@TitleType='DisplayTitle']/TitleText` (used in albums/EPs but not single tracks)
- `Title[@TitleType='DisplayTitle']/SubTitle`
- `Title[@TitleType='FormalTitle']/TitleText`
- `Title[@TitleType='FormalTitle']/SubTitle`

#### child elements of `/ReleaseList/Release/ReleaseDetailsByTerritory[TerritoryCode="Worldwide"]/ResourceGroup/`

ICPN (or "International Code Product Number") has an `IsEAN` attribute which determines if it’s an
EAN (or "European Article Number") or UPC ("Universal Product Code" — only used in US and Canada).

Audius uses these interchangeably and just set it as UPC even if it’s an EAN.
