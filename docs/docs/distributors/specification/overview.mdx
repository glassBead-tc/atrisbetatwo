## General Guidance

:::info Delivery processing

[TikiLabs](https://tikilabs.com) is a facilitator of distributing DDEX directly to the Audius
Protocol.

For inquiries or support, reach out at
[support@audius.co](mailto:support@audius.co?subject=DDEX%20Support).

:::

- ERN3 is the preferred DDEX specification for bulk ingestion into Audius. See the
  [ERN3 details](/distributors/specification/deal-types/recommended) for more details around
  submission choreography.
- Audius only accepts price information using absolute prices (e.g. via `WholesalePricePerUnit`).
  Price codes will be ignored (e.g. `PriceType`).
- Audius also does not support `ValidityPeriod` `EndDate`s. This includes using `EndDate` to specify
  multiple `ValidityPeriod`s with different prices. We can only parse 1 `ValidityPeriod`
  `StartDate`.
- Audius currently only accepts the `Worldwide` `TerritoryCode`. Territory support for controlled
  streaming is coming soon! ðŸŒŽ
- `NonInteractiveStream` is not supported.
- A `ReleaseDeal` is required with a `DealReleaseReference` to each track on an album.
- A `ReleaseDeal` is not required with a `DealReleaseReference` to an album release. If an album
  deal is not specified, the album defaults to being free to stream, but each of its tracks is
  configured according to the trackâ€™s `ReleaseDeal` `DealTerms`.
- Audius supports updates via `NewReleaseMessage` and takedowns of content via `PurgeReleaseMessage`
  through matching `ReleaseId` properties.
